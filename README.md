### COVID-19 Detection Using Random Forest

## Overview
This project involves detecting COVID-19 cases using a Random Forest classifier. The model is trained on a dataset containing COVID-19 statistics from various states and union territories in India. 
The data includes the number of confirmed cases, cured cases, deaths, and other relevant features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

1. Sno: Serial number
2. Date: Date of record
3. Time: Time of record
4. State/UnionTerritory: The region in India
5. ConfirmedIndianNational: Number of confirmed Indian nationals
6. ConfirmedForeignNational: Number of confirmed foreign nationals
7. Cured: Number of cured cases
8. Deaths: Number of deaths
9. Confirmed: Total number of confirmed cases

### Installation
